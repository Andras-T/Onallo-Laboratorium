# Onallo-Laboratorium

This project is a C++ application that uses Vulkan, a low-level graphics API, to create a networked app that can stream images between a client and a server. The client app will send user input to the server, which will process it and render the current image using Vulkan. The server will then send the image back to the client, which will display it on the screen. The app will use UDP protocol to achieve fast network communication. The app will also use Valve GameNetworkingSockets library, which provides a high-level interface for network sockets, and ImGui library, which provides a simple and easy-to-use graphical user interface.
